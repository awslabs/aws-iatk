## AWS Cloud Test Kit

AWS Cloud Test Kit (CTK), a new open-source test library that makes it easier for developers to create tests for cloud applications with increased speed and accuracy. With AWS CTK, developers can quickly write tests that exercise their code and its AWS integrations against an environment in the cloud, making it easier to catch mistakes early in the development process. CTK includes utilities to generate test events, validate event delivery and structure in Amazon EventBridge Event Bus, and assertions to validate call flow using AWS X-Ray traces.

The CTK is available for Python3.8+

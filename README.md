# Examples

Below lists the examples to showcase how you can use AWS CTK to write integration against the cloud more easily.

To run the examples in Python (3.8+):
```bash
# setup venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example01 - retrieving information from a deployed stack

This example shows how to use `get_stack_outputs` and `get_physical_id_from_stack` to retrieve information from a deployed stack. They are useful if you deploy your stack directly with a CloudFormation template.

We will use SAM CLI to deploy a [stack](./example01/template.json) to CloudFormation. For Python, we will use `pytest` to run the [test code](./example01/test_example_01.py).

To setup SAM CLI, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)

To run the example:

```bash
# navigate into the example01 dir
cd "01-cfn_utils"

# To deploy the stack under test using SAM CLI:
sam deploy --stack-name example-01 --template ./template.json

# Run the Python example:
pytest test_example_01.py
```

To clean up the stack after running the example:

```bash
sam delete --stack-name example-01
```

## Example02 - Testing EventBridge Event Bus with "Listener"

To run this example, we will use CDK to define and deploy the stacks under test.

To setup CDK, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

To deploy the stacks:

```bash
# navigate to the example02-04 dir
cd "02-eb_listener"

# install dependencies for building and deploying
npm install

# Deploy the stack using cdk, see package.json for definition of the command:
npm run deploy

```

Note that, after deploy completes, an output file `outputs.json` is created, with contents similar to below:

```json
{
  "example-ebStack": {
    "EventBusName": "examplestack01EB321ED36B",
    "ApiEndpoint": "https://xxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/orders",
    "APIEndpoint1793E782": "https://xxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/",
    "RuleName": "examplestack01EB321ED36B|example-stack-01-ConsumerRuleEE1F6314-12K2NOJQRM8A6",
    "TargetId": "Target0"
  }
}

```

This is one of the ways to pass deployed values into the tests. Alternatively, you can also use AWS CTK's `get_stack_outputs` method to retrieve stack outputs.

Here are the example test code:

- [Python](./02-eb_listener/tests/python/test_example_02.py)

This example shows how to use a "Listener" to test a Rule on a given Event Bus. The stack under test is called "cdk-example-ebStack". Three methods are used in this example:

- `add_listener` - create a listener on the provided event bus by replicating a provided rule and target transformation
- `remove_listener` - destroy listener(s)
- `wait_until_event_matched` -  wait until a received event matches the provided `condition` function
- `poll_events` - poll events from the listener and return the received events

To run the example:

```bash
pytest tests/python/test_example_02.py
```

To clean up the stacks after running the examples:

```bash
npm run destroy
```

## Example03 - Testing end-to-end with X-Ray Traces

To run this example, we will use CDK to define and deploy the stacks under test.

To setup CDK, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

To deploy the stacks:

```bash
# navigate to the example02-04 dir
cd "03-xray_trace_tree"

# install dependencies for building and deploying
npm install

# Deploy the stack using cdk, see package.json for definition of the command:
npm run deploy

```

Note that, after deploy completes, an output file `outputs.json` is created, with contents similar to below:

```json
{
  "example-sfnStack": {
    "StateMachineArn": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:MyStateMachine6C968CA5-Ybusf26S5Oir",
    "StateMachineName": "MyStateMachine6C968CA5-Ybusf26S5Oir"
  }
}

```

This is one of the ways to pass deployed values into the tests. Alternatively, you can also use AWS CTK's `get_stack_outputs` method to retrieve stack outputs.

Here are the example test code:

- [Python](./03-xray_trace_tree/tests/python/test_example_03.py)

This example shows how to test end-to-end with X-Ray Traces. The stack under test is called "cdk-example-sfnStack". Two methods are used in this example:

- `retry_get_trace_tree_until` - retry getting trace tree of given trace ID until it matches the provided `condition`
- `get_trace_tree` - get trace tree of given trace ID. This performs the action once only

To run the example:

```bash
pytest tests/python/test_example_03.py
```

To clean up the stacks after running the examples:

```bash
npm run destroy
```

### Example04 - Mock Event Generation

To run this example, we will use CDK to define and deploy the stacks under test.

To setup CDK, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

To deploy the stacks:

```bash
# navigate to the example02-04 dir
cd "04-event_generation"

# install dependencies for building and deploying
npm install

# Deploy the stack using cdk, see package.json for definition of the command:
npm run deploy

```

Note that, after deploy completes, an output file `outputs.json` is created, with contents similar to below:

```json
{
  "example-schemaStack": {
    "CalculatorFunction": "cdk-example-schemaStack-CalculatorBxxxxF40-5SYJsAlTscGC",
    "RegistryName": "MyRegsitry-xx5rNdAMGJL1",
    "SchemaName": "MySchema-xxKd3I1NbYAu"
  }
}


```

This is one of the ways to pass deployed values into the tests. Alternatively, you can also use AWS CTK's `get_stack_outputs` method to retrieve stack outputs.

Here are the example test code:

- [Python](./04-event_generation/tests/python/test_example_04.py)


This example shows how to generate mock event. An example EventBrige Schema Registry and Schema are deployed through the "cdk-example-schemaStack". In the example, we use the `generate_mock_event` to generate a mock event from given Registry and Schema. The three test cases showcases the followings:

### `test_generate_barebone_event`

Generate a barebone event without any context. In this test case, the resultant mock event looks like:

```json
{
    "address": "",
    "customerId": "",
    "datetime": "2023-09-29T08:04:48.791605-07:00",
    "membershipType": "A",
    "orderItems": []
}
```

### `test_generate_contextful_event`

Generate a contextful event by supplying `contexts`. You can specify a list of "context" to apply on the barebone event. Each "context" is a function accepting an event and returning the modified event. The resultant mock event looks like:

```json
{
    "address": "99 Some Street",
    "customerId": "d09c95e2-8b67-4e1a-a957-49b5d3d12af2",
    "datetime": "2023-09-29T08:07:21.18875-07:00",
    "membershipType": "A",
    "orderItems": [
        {
            "unitPrice": 2,
            "count": 1
        },
        {
            "unitPrice": 4,
            "count": 2
        },
        {
            "unitPrice": 6,
            "count": 3
        },
        {
            "unitPrice": 8,
            "count": 4
        },
        {
            "unitPrice": 10,
            "count": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

This example also shows that you can use the generated event as a payload to invoke a Lambda Function. Similarly, you can generate an event and use it as payload to invoke any event consumer, like Lambda Function or Step Function State Machine.

### `test_generate_eventbridge_event`

You can generate event from any schema in the "aws.events" Registry. The "aws.events" Registry stores schemas for AWS events sent to the default Event Bus from your AWS resources. For EventBridge events, you can apply the `eventbridge_event_context` context. The resultant event looks like:

```json
{
    "account": "123456789101",
    "detail": {
        "ActivityId": "",
        "AutoScalingGroupName": "",
        "Cause": "",
        "Description": "",
        "Destination": "",
        "Details": {
            "Availability Zone": "",
            "Subnet ID": ""
        },
        "EC2InstanceId": "",
        "EndTime": "2023-09-29T08:10:27.837869-07:00",
        "Origin": "",
        "RequestId": "",
        "StartTime": "2023-09-29T08:10:27.837874-07:00",
        "StatusCode": "",
        "StatusMessage": ""
    },
    "detail-type": "detail-type",
    "id": "cb37b81c-5640-45c8-87eb-6eee4a667866",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [],
    "source": "source",
    "time": "2023-09-29T08:10:27.837867-07:00",
    "version": "0"
}
```

To run the example:

```bash
pytest tests/python/test_example_04.py
```

To clean up the stacks after running the examples:

```bash
npm run destroy
```

## AWS Integrated Application Test Kit (IATK)

:warning: **AWS Integrated Application Test Kit is under Public Preview**

AWS Integrated Application Test Kit (IATK), a new open-source test library that makes it easier for developers to create tests for cloud applications with increased speed and accuracy. With AWS IATK, developers can quickly write tests that exercise their code and its AWS integrations against an environment in the cloud, making it easier to catch mistakes early in the development process. IATK includes utilities to generate test events, validate event delivery and structure in Amazon EventBridge Event Bus, and assertions to validate call flow using AWS X-Ray traces.

The AWS IATK is available for Python3.8+
